<p>A reduced workload for the customer service agents</p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em> The webchat bot can automatically handle repetitive and common customer queries, which means fewer routine calls and emails need to be answered by human agents. This reduces their workload and allows them to focus on more complex or high‑value customer issues. While sales or product reliability may improve indirectly, the primary and immediate business benefit is lowering the operational burden on the support team.</p>

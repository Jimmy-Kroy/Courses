<h4>1. A company employs a team of customer service agents to provide telephone and email support to customers. The company develops a webchat bot to provide automated answers to common customer queries. Which business benefit should the company expect as a result of creating the webchat bot solution?</h4>
<ol type="a">
<li>Increased sales</li>
<li>A reduced workload for the customer service agents</li>
<li>Improved product reliability</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
<p>A reduced workload for the customer service agents</p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em> The webchat bot can automatically handle repetitive and common customer queries, which means fewer routine calls and emails need to be answered by human agents. This reduces their workload and allows them to focus on more complex or high‑value customer issues. While sales or product reliability may improve indirectly, the primary and immediate business benefit is lowering the operational burden on the support team.</p>

# Azure AI-900 Fundamentals Practice Questions

Welcome to a comprehensive collection of practice questions designed to aid your preparation for the AI-900 exam, your gateway to understanding Azure fundamentals in artificial intelligence.

<h2>How to Utilise this Repository</h2>

This repository is thoughtfully divided into two sections. The first section comprises practice questions provided by Microsoft within their training modules. The second section features additional questions curated by me, aligning with various modules covered in the exam syllabus.

To optimise your study experience, it's highly recommended to begin with the [official learning modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification). Establishing a foundational understanding through these modules will strengthen your grasp of the subject matter, which can then be reinforced and expanded upon with the questions provided here.

Don't feel overwhelmed by the amount of questions! They are organised into modules, ensuring a structured and thorough preparation process.
